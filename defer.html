    <h1>How defer Works:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The browser starts downloading app.js in parallel with parsing the HTML.
      </li>
      <li>
        The script execution is deferred until the HTML document is fully
        parsed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If multiple scripts have defer, they are executed in order as they
        appear in the HTML.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Why use defer?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Improves page load speed: The browser doesn't block rendering while
        downloading the script.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensures DOM is ready: The script executes after the full HTML is parsed,
        so document.querySelector() and other DOM manipulations wonâ€™t fail.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preserves script order: Unlike async, defer ensures scripts run in the
        order they appear.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <\script defer> when the script interacts with the DOM.</li>
      <li>Use <\script async> for independent scripts like analytics.</li>
      <li>Use either defer or async, don't leave it blank</li>
    </ul>
